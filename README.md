# DL2022
### Solutions to homeworks From BGU EE DL curse given by Dr. Nir Shlezinger in fall 2022.
* All homeworks are with Google Colab 
- In work1 we will build models to predict which century a piece of music was released,We will be using the "YearPredictionMSD Data Set".
In this assignment we are not allowed to use pytorch yet
- In work2, we will make a neural network that can predict the next word in a sentence given the previous three.
In doing this prediction task, our neural networks will learn about words and about how to represent words. We'll explore the vector representations of words that our model produces, and analyze these representations.
- In work3 , we will build a convolutional neural network that can predict whether two shoes are from the same pair or from two different pairs. the data is gatherd from images
taken by pepole. We examine 2 different CNN's 
- In work4, we will train a model to produce new human faces with variational autoencoders (VAEs).In this assignment, we will build, train and analyze a VAE with the CelebA dataset. We will analyze how well images can be reconstructed from the lower dimensional representations and try to generate images that look similar to the images in the CelebA dataset.
